       <center><p style="font-size: 25px; color: black;font-style: italic; text-align: justify;">Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001.
            During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.
            Aged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1–0 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003,coming on as a half-time substitute for Luís Figo.
            He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal.
            After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals,[292] he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands.
            He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.</p>
            <h2 style="color: red; font-size: 35px;">CAPTAINCY</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;text-align: justify;">
            One day after his 22nd birthday, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007,as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier.
            Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time.[306] While he scored eight goals in the qualification,[307] the second-highest tally, 
            he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic; in the same game, 
            he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance.
            Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3–2 loss against eventual finalists Germany.

            After Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United.
            Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008.
            Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup,as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.
            In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil.[314][315][316] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months.
            Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.[318]

            Ronaldo scored seven goals in the qualification for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a "group of death".
            In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2–1 win.[320] He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1–0 win.[321] In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match.
            After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, with Ronaldo having sent three shots over the bar,[324] Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot,[325] a decision that was questioned by the media.
            Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo "demanded" to take the last penalty.
            As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, 
            he was again included in the team of the tournament.</p>
           
            <h2 style="color: red; font-size: 35px;">ALWAYS TOP SCORER AND EUROPEAN CHAMPION</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;text-align: justify;">
            During the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. 
            A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap.
            His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4–2 qualifying win on 6 September 2013.
            After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović, which ensured their place at the tournament.
            His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equaling Pauleta's record.[334] Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5–1 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.

            Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury,[336][337] potentially risking his career.
            Ronaldo later commented: "If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't."
            Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice,[340] Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat.
            After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States,[342] he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 win over Ghana.[343] His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups.
            Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.</p>
            
            <h2 style="color: red; font-size: 35px;">NATIONS LEAGUE</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;text-align: justify;">
            After the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019.
            In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan.
            In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0.
